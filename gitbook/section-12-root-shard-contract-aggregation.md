# Section 12: Root Shard Contract Aggregation

**Mathematical Model**

> The Root Shard Contract Aggregation in the SMT protocol involves an intricate mathematical framework for aggregating state proofs from various child shards. The root shard plays a pivotal role in collating these proofs to maintain a comprehensive view of the network's state. The aggregation process is mathematically represented as:

$$
\text{AggregateState}(\{ \pi_{1}, \pi_{2}, \ldots, \pi_{n} \}) = H(H(\pi_{1}) \, || \, H(\pi_{2}) \, || \, \ldots \, || \, H(\pi_{n}))
$$

where each$$\ \pi_{i}$$ is the state proof from shard $$\ i, \text{and} \ H \$$is a cryptographic hash function.

This model is integral in ensuring that the overall state of the network is accurately and securely represented, accounting for the data from all individual shards.

#### 8.2 Cryptographic Accumulator

> The cryptographic accumulator within the root shard is a sophisticated tool used to merge proofs from different shards effectively. This is vital for confirming the consistency and integrity of the aggregated state. The accumulator function can be detailed as follows:

$$
\text{Accumulator}(\{ \pi_{1}, \pi_{2}, \ldots, \pi_{n} \}) = H(\pi_{1} \oplus \pi_{2} \oplus \ldots \oplus \pi_{n})
$$

where $$\ (\oplus)$$ represents a cryptographic operation (such as $$XOR$$) used to combine the proofs.

This function ensures that the aggregation process is not only efficient but also secure, upholding the integrity of the blockchain network.

#### Security Analysis

> A rigorous security analysis is essential for validating the robustness of the Root Shard Contract Aggregation model. This analysis focuses on the cryptographic strength of the aggregation process, particularly in terms of collision resistance and the immutability of the aggregated state. Key aspects of this analysis include:

$$\text{CollisionResistant}(\text{Accumulator}) = \forall { \pi_{1}, \pi_{2}, \ldots, \pi_{n} }, { \pi'{1}, \pi'{2}, \ldots, \pi'_{n} } \in \Pi, \text{Accumulator}(\Pi) \neq \text{Accumulator}(\Pi')$$

* **Collision Resistance**: Ensuring that it is computationally infeasible for two different sets of shard proofs to result in the same aggregated state.
* **Immutability Analysis**: Proving that once a shard state is aggregated, it cannot be altered or tampered with without being detected.

$$
\text{Immutability}(\text{AggregateState}) = \text{if} \ \Delta \text{AggregateState} \neq 0, \text{then} \ \text{tampering detected}
$$
