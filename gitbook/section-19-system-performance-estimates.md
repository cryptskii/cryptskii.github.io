# Section 19: System Performance Estimates

Based on the mathematical model and assumed benchmarks, the performance of the SMT protocol is estimated as follows:

#### Assumptions

* **Total Throughput**: Approximately $$( 500,000 )$$ transactions per second, based on the assumption that each of the $$100$$ shards processes $$5,000$$ transactions per second.
* **Total Latency**: Approximately $$( 50 )$$ milliseconds, determined by the component with the highest latency, presumed to be the consensus mechanism.

***

#### Insights and Implications

* **High Throughput**: Reflects the protocol's efficiency in handling large volumes of transactions, leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of asynchronous sharding.
* **Manageable Latency**: The low latency is a significant achievement, especially given the complexities inherent in sharded architectures and global ordering mechanisms.

***

#### Caveats and Future Directions

* **Assumptions**: This model relies on assumed benchmarks and simplifications, and actual performance may vary based on implementation specifics, network conditions, hardware capabilities, and deployment scale.
* **Empirical Validation**: Accurate performance metrics necessitate empirical testing and real-world deployment, which would also help identify potential optimization areas and bottlenecks.

This model offers a theoretical perspective on the potential performance of the SMT protocol, emphasizing its ability to manage high transaction volumes with relatively low latency, a crucial factor for scalable blockchain solutions.
