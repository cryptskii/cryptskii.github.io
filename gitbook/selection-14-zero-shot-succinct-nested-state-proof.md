# Selection 14: Zero-Shot Succinct Nested State Proof

### Introduction

The Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) shard synchronization in the Sierpinski Merkle Trie (SMT) blockchain system is a complex yet crucial component for maintaining data integrity and consistency across the network. This section presents an in-depth formal analysis of this mechanism.

### Mathematical Framework

Consider a set of shards $${S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_n}$$, each maintaining a state $$s_i$$. The ZKP for each shard state is formulated as $$\pi_i = \text{ZKProof}(s_i)$$, where:

$$
\pi_i = \text{ZK-SNARK-Prove}(s_i)
$$

The proof $$\pi_i$$ asserts the validity of state $$s_i$$ without revealing its contents.

### Composite Proof Verification

At the root level, the composite proof $\Pi$ is an aggregation of individual shard proofs:

$$
\Pi = \bigoplus_{i=1}^{n} \pi_i
$$

where $$\bigoplus$$ represents a cryptographic operation that combines individual proofs into a single, verifiable proof of the global state.

### Integration with SMT and Triadic Consensus

* **SMT Nodes**: Each shard's state and its corresponding $$ZKP$$ are integrated into the $$SMT$$ nodes, preserving the hierarchical structure.
* **Triadic Consensus**: The triadic consensus mechanism validates local transactions and contributes to the global state through the aggregated proof.
* **Cross-Shard Transactions**: Ensured by exchanging signed Merkle proofs, these transactions maintain the principles of atomicity and non-repudiation.

### Optimization and Scalability

The Sierpinski Merkle Trie $$(SMT)$$ blockchain employs an advanced technique called Zero-Shot Succinct Nested State Proofs $$(ZSSNSP)$$ to enable efficient verification and synchronization between shards.

### Overview

In $$ZSSNSP$$, each shard maintains a succinct cryptographic proof of its state, which is nested within a global state proof for the entire blockchain. This allows efficient validation of both local shard states and the global state.

### Shard State Proofs

Each shard $$S_i$$ maintains its state $$s_i$$, which includes balances, contracts, transaction history etc.

A state proof $$\pi_i$$ is generated for the shard state $$s_i$$ using a succinct argument scheme:

$$\pi_i = \text{Prove}(s_i)$$

The proof $$\pi_i$$ can be verified without revealing $$s_i$$:

$$\text{Verify}(\pi_i) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } \pi_i \text{ is valid} \ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

### Global State Proof

The global state proof $$\Pi$$ aggregates the shard state proofs:

$$\Pi = \text{Aggregate}(\pi_1, \pi_2, \dots, \pi_n)$$

It enables verifying the combined blockchain state.

### Nested Proof Structure

The key innovation in ZSSNSP is nesting each shard proof $$\pi_i$$ within the global proof $$\Pi$$:

$$\pi_i = \text{Prove}(s_i || \Pi)$$

This provides two benefits:

* Verification of shard states within the context of the global state.
* Constant proof size - $$\pi_i$$ remains fixed size regardless of blockchain growth.

### Advantages

* **Efficient verification**: Enables $$O(1)$$ verification of shard and global states.
* **Scalability**: Adding shards does not increase proof size or verification cost.
* **Blockchain history**: Each proof contains the full history due to nesting.
* **Freshness**: The global proof ensures freshness of approved shard states.

In summary, ZSSNSP provides a novel architecture for scalable and verifiable blockchain systems using succinct, nested cryptographic proofs. The section demonstrates the approach mathematically and explains the resulting benefits. The expansions aim to highlight the ingenuity of the technique and its alignment with the goals of the SMT protocol.

### Conclusion

The extensive formalization and integration of $$ZKPs$$ provide a secure and efficient method for shard synchronization, playing a vital role in the scalability and integrity of the $$SMT$$ blockchain system.

## Balance Invariance

### Definitions and Notations

We define the key terms and notations required to formally analyze the protocol:

* Let the sharded blockchain network comprise of $$n$$ shards denoted by the set $$S = {S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_n}$$.
* Each shard $$S_i$$ maintains its own independent state $$s_i$$ including balances, transactions, contracts, etc.
* The balance invariance property states that the total native token supply across all shards must equal the total balances of all accounts across shards. Formally,

$$
\forall x \in U, \sum_{i=1}^{n}{B_i(x)} = B_{total}(x)
$$

where $$U$$ is the universe of all accounts, $$B_i(x)$$ is the balance of account $$x$$ in shard $$S_i$$, and $$B_{total}(x)$$ is the total balance of $$x$$ across all shards.

* The $$SMT$$ is a hierarchical cryptographic data structure that accumulates states of shards and transactions to facilitate integrity verification.

### Balance Invariance Lemmas

We state and prove two key lemmas regarding balance invariance:

**Lemma 1**: Each shard $$S_i$$ maintains balances independently in its state $$s_i$$ according to transactions within the shard.

_Proof_: By the nature of sharding, each shard operates autonomously, updating its state based on intra-shard transactions. Inter-shard communication is limited to synchronization. Thus, the balance changes in each shard depend only on transactions within that shard.

**Lemma 2**: The total native token supply is equal to the sum of all shard balances $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}{B_i(x)}$$.

_Proof_: The native token supply is defined during network initialization and new tokens cannot be created or destroyed. Tokens are transferred between shards through verifiable cross-shard transactions. Thus, by conservation, the total supply must always equal the total balances across all shards.

Together, these lemmas establish that balance invariance emerges from the autonomy of shards and conservation of native tokens.

### SMT Structure for Verification

The SMT structure facilitates efficient verification of balance invariance through accumulation and Merkle proofs, as formalized below:

```
// SMT Update

Input: Transaction tx, State Merkle Tree smt

shard ← tx.shard  

update ← Execute(tx)

smt.UpdateNode(shard, update)

root ← smt.ComputeRoot() 

// Return new root of SMT

return root
```

**Theorem 1:** The $$SMT$$ root accumulates the state of all shards and facilitates efficient integrity verification through succinct Merkle proofs.

_Proof:_ The $$SMT$$ structure mirrors the shard topology, with each shard having a corresponding node that summarizes its state. Any update within a shard is reflected in the node, which then propagates upwards through hash accumulators up to the root. The root hash encodes the joint state of all shards. The Merkle proof system enables efficient verification of the presence and integrity of transactions within this global state using $$O(log n)$$ space and time complexity.

Thus, the $$SMT$$ structure provides an efficient cryptographic data structure for verifying balance invariance.

### Security Analysis

We analyze the security of balance invariance in the $$SMT$$ protocol by considering possible attack vectors:

#### Intra-shard Attacks

Malicious actors controlling a subset of nodes within a shard are prevented from manipulating balances through the shard's own consensus mechanism.

**Lemma 3:** If the adversary controls less than $$\frac{1}{3}$$ of nodes in the triadic $$SMT$$ shard structure, they cannot influence consensus decisions.

_Proof:_ Follows directly from the $$\frac{2}{3}$$ fault tolerance threshold in each triad. A forked state would be detectable and rejected by honest nodes.

Thus, intra-shard attacks are mitigated by the shard's internal consensus and integrity mechanisms.

#### Cross-shard Attack Vectors

We consider two kinds of attacks aimed at disrupting balance invariance across shards:

1. Fake Transaction Attack: Adversary broadcasts fake cross-shard transactions to illegally mint tokens.
2. Double Spending Attack: Adversary performs a double spend across shards.

However, the $$SMT$$ structure prevents both attacks:

* Fake transactions are detected because the adversary cannot produce valid Merkle proofs for the receiving shard to verify the transfer's integrity.
* Double spends are prevented because cross-shard transactions lock the funds atomically in both sending and receiving shards before finalizing the transfer.

**Lemma 4:** The $$SMT$$ protocol guarantees balance invariance security under reasonable assumptions on the underlying cryptographic primitives and honest shard majority.

_Proof:_ Follows from the threshold adversary tolerance in consensus, the binding and hiding properties of commitment schemes, the security of digital signatures, and the collision resistance of hash functions.

Thus, balance invariance is maintained securely even under a broad array of adversarial attacks.
